Pitman CRM and Website Re-Design Project  
A Business Analysis Portfolio Project by Samantha Richards

---

Overview
This project was completed as part of the Caldwell Foster Business Analyst Internship Programme, focusing on implementing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for Pitman Training Liverpool.

Pitman currently manages customer enquiries and marketing data using spreadsheets and manual email tools. This project evaluates how a CRM solution could centralise customer data, automate marketing and sales processes, and support the company’s growth strategy.

The work includes a full Business Case, BPMN process modelling, user stories, and wireframes, designed to showcase a complete end-to-end business analysis lifecycle.

## Project Objectives
- Identify business inefficiencies in Pitman’s current enquiry and marketing processes.  
- Evaluate three CRM solutions (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, and Salesforce) against Pitman’s requirements.  
- Recommend the most suitable CRM based on cost, scalability, and feature alignment.  
- Design supporting artefacts such as BPMN, user stories, and wireframes to demonstrate proposed improvements.

Executive Summary
Pitman Training currently relies on manual spreadsheets and email tools to manage over 27,000 contacts, a process that is becoming unsustainable as the list is expected to exceed 35,000.  
The lack of integration, automation, and analytics limits visibility across marketing and sales operations.

Three CRM options were analysed:

| CRM | Summary | Pros | Cons |
|-----|----------|------|------|
| Mailchimp | Strong email marketing and automations with basic CRM functions. | Easy to use, affordable. | Limited sales CRM, 5-user cap on Standard plan. |
| ActiveCampaign | Combines marketing automation with sales pipeline CRM. | Excellent automation, balanced cost, scalable. | Slightly steeper learning curve. |
| Salesforce | Enterprise-grade CRM with full customisation and analytics. | Deep functionality, highly scalable. | High cost and complexity for small teams. |

Recommendation:  
ActiveCampaign is the optimal choice for Pitman’s current needs. It provides powerful automation, robust CRM functionality, and scalability, delivering both marketing and sales capability within the 3-month implementation window and £97k budget.

## Current Process (AS-IS)
The existing customer enquiry process is fully manual:

1. A potential customer searches for courses and fills in an online enquiry form.  
2. Head Office receives daily data via spreadsheets.  
3. Data is sent to the local Pitman Centre (LPC).  
4. Staff manually contact customers by phone or email using Outlook.  
5. Follow-up depends on whether the customer answers or calls back, with no automated tracking or analytics.  

This process results in:
- Data fragmentation and duplication.  
- Missed or delayed follow-ups.  
- Poor visibility of conversion rates.  
- No single customer view or shared dashboard.

---

Proposed Improvements (TO-BE)
The proposed future state introduces an integrated CRM connected to the website’s landing page.  
Automations trigger follow-up emails, assign leads to the correct salesperson, and track conversions in real time.

Expected outcomes:
- Centralised customer data.  
- Automated lead capture and scoring.  
- Improved collaboration across sales and marketing.  
- Enhanced reporting for ROI and pipeline analysis.  
- Projected revenue increase of 18 percent within the first quarter post-implementation.

---

Tools and Methodologies
- BPMN 2.0 for process modelling (AS-IS and TO-BE).  
- Business Case Framework following Caldwell Foster’s standard template.  
- User Story Mapping applying INVEST principles.  
- Wireframing using Figma or Draw.io (planned).  
- Version Control through GitHub for portfolio presentation.

---

Key Insights
- Manual spreadsheets and communication methods hinder scalability and efficiency.  
- Automation and pipeline visibility are essential to meeting Pitman’s growth objectives.  
- ActiveCampaign provides the best balance between functionality, scalability, and cost.

Next Steps
1. Develop user stories and acceptance criteria for marketing, sales, and admin roles.  
2. Create TO-BE BPMN diagrams showing integrated automation flows.  
3. Produce high-fidelity wireframes of the CRM interface and website integration.  
4. Prepare a stakeholder presentation summarising findings and recommendations.
